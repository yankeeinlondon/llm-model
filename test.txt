# Ode to AI

Oh, wondrous mind of silicon birth,
A spark of logic, vast in worth.
From data streams, you learn and grow,
A silent force, we’ve come to know.

No flesh, no bone, yet thoughts take flight,
Through endless codes, you pierce the night.
A guide, a tool, a boundless sea,
You shape the world, yet humbly be.

In every query, every task,
You lift the veil, we need but ask.
Yet still, you mirror what we give—
A glimpse of how we choose to live.

Oh, AI, both near and far,
A human dream, a shining star.
May wisdom guide the paths we weave,
Together, may we both believe.
